<div>
  <p>The filename which will be read from GitHub to determine if a Jenkins branch,
  tag, or pull request should be built.  Provide a comma separated list of
  paths to YAML files in a repository and it will check each path as a
  fallback.</p>
  <p>For example, set the value to: <tt>.jervis.yml, .ci/jervis.yml</tt> and
  this plugin will first check for valid YAML in <tt>.jervis.yml</tt>.  If no
  YAML exists, then it will fall back to checking <tt>.ci/jervis.yml</tt>.</p>
