<div>
  <p>This will look at the root of a GitHub reference for <tt>.jervis.yml</tt> for the branches and tags filtering.  You can customize the name of the YAML file searched for if you like.</p>
  <p>For Tags:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It will filter for the tag name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For Branches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It will filter for the branch name.</li>
    <li>It will filter for pull requests destined for the branch name.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Example YAML</h2>
  <code><pre>
branches:
  only:
    - main
</pre></code>

  <h1>More on specify branches and tags to build</h1>

  <p>By default Jervis will generate Jenkins jobs for all branches that have a
  <tt>.jervis.yml</tt> file.  You can control and limit this behavior by
  specifying the <tt>branches</tt> or <tt>tags</tt> key in your
  <tt>.jervis.yml</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Allow or block branches and tags</h3>

  <p>You can either create an allow list of branches (only) or a block list of
  branches (except) to be built.</p>

  <code><pre>
# block branches from building
branches:
  except:
    - legacy
    - experimental

# allow only these branches
branches:
  only:
    - main
    - stable
</pre></code>

  <p>The same YAML can be applied to tags.</p>

  <code><pre>
# block tags from building
tags:
  except:
    - .*-rc
    - .*-beta

# allow only these tags
tags:
  only:
    - v[.0-9]+
</pre></code>

  <p>If you specify both <tt>only</tt> and <tt>except</tt>, then
  <tt>except</tt> will be ignored.  <tt>.jervis.yml</tt> needs to be present on
  all branches you want to be built.  <tt>.jervis.yml</tt> will be interpreted
  in the context of that branch so if you specify an allow list in your main
  branch, then it will not propagate to other branches.</p>

  <h3>Using regular expressions</h3>

  <p>You can use regular expressions to allow or block branches:</p>

  <code><pre>
branches:
  only:
    - main
    - /^[.0-9]+-hotfix$/
</pre></code>

  <p>Any name surrounded with <tt>/</tt> in the list of branches is treated as
  a regular expression.  The expression will use
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile%28java.lang.String%29"><tt>Pattern.compile</tt></a>
  to compile the regex string into a
  <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/index.html#_regular_expression_operators">Groovy regular expression</a>.</p>
