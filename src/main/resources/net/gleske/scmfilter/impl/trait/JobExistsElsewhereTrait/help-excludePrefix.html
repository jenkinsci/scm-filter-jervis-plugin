  <p>
    Any jobs whose full name matches this value will be excluded from
    consideration and no jobs will be created.  This filter is combined with
    the include prefix option; so any job not included or excluded will end up
    skipping the job being created for a branch, tag, or PR.
  </p>
  <p>
    This value can be a job full name prefix (what the job full path starts
    with) or a pattern which matches against the job full name.
  </p>
  <p>For examples, see the top-level help for this trait.</p>
