<div>
  <p>This is a time limit (in seconds) for how long this trait will wait for companion jobs to exist in matched pipelines (pipelines are matched from the above include or exclude filters).</p>
  <p>
    If the value is zero, then no grace period will be considered.  If the
    companion job does not immediately exist then it will assume there's no
    match.  This is not typical for cloud-based systems where there will likely
    be delays.  A recommended value of 60 seconds is the default and you can
    set this to be higher if needed.
